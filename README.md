# Framework Evaluator

## Getting Started

I was not happy with my previous submission, so I spent my free time over the weekend working on the challenge and doing additional research on React.js and Rest APIs. I learned a ton and hope it is shown in my results.

The attributes I decided to focus on are Stargazers_count, Forks, and Open issues.

I decided to use a table because it was an easy way to organize, sort data, and it would be easy to add additional frameworks.

The columns can be updated by simply clicking on the column heads, but the sorting order is lost when the page is refreshed after 30 seconds.

If given more time I would love to add framework commits.
